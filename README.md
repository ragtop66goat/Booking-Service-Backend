//How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

    Validating input is the first step in ensuring security. Proper input validation, especially those from external
    sources, can eliminate a large majority of vulnerabilities. Using effective quality assurance/testing tools, like JUNIT, 
    is a way to ensure the white box portion of a project is up to industry standards. As for functionality beyond errors and
    exceptions, manually testing the code for expected results, or black box testing, should be done by multiple individuals. 
    
//How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

    After gathering an initial list of requirements it's helpful to split them inot the two main types, functionality and 
    constraints. From there I typically draw up pseudocode to get a better understanding of how many classes/files the project 
    may need, and then start to add blocks of commented code that outline the requirements. This serves as a sort of checklist to 
    systematically fill in as the solution is developed.
    
//How do I approach designing software?
    
    Keeping software atchitecture as simple as possible is a great way to approach code design. the more complex and nested loops 
    or blocks of code become, the more likely it is that bugs or unintended functionality are intoduced. As previously mentioned, I 
    prefer to go from pseudocode to files outlined in commented code, to fiiling them min with versions of the finished product.
